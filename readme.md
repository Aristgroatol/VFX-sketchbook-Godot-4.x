FVX sketchbook made in Godot 4.0

for fun and exploration

I'm opening up this repository, but I'm in no case endorsing this project as a tutorial or actual learning resources

please, notice that I'm making those effects in my free time, they are not thought for production as I try things out prioritizing fun iteration over optimized solutions. if you have optimization proposition don't hesitate to open a request

small side project
